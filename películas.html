            Main article: John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum
            John Wick is on the run, being hunted with a $14 million 'open' contract on his life for breaking a foundational rule: taking a life on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim, Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) was a member of the High Table—the organization that ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, but the Continental's manager, 
            Winston Scott (Ian McShane), has given him a one-hour grace period before he is excommunicado—his membership will revoked and he will be banned from all services and cut off from other members. John uses favors and contacts accrued in his former life to stay alive as he fights his way out of New York City.
